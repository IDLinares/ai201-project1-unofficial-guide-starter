## Domain

<!-- What topic or category of knowledge does your system cover?
     Why is this knowledge valuable, and why is it hard to find through official channels?
     Example: "Student reviews of CS professors at [university] — useful because official
     course descriptions don't reflect teaching style, exam difficulty, or workload." -->

Domain: Activities to do at/around the University of Florida
This knowledge is valuable cause it lets students know what kind of activities and experiences they can do in their free-time when attending the University of Florida and for who and when these activities are appropriate. Although you can find some events happening on campus through official channels, knowing all of the possible activites to do around Gainesville can be useful to know the full extent of what Gainesville has to offer. Many people consider Gainesville to just be the University of Florida, but there are a lot of different things to do on and around campus.

## Chunking Strategy

<!-- Describe your chunking approach with enough specificity that someone else could reproduce it.
     Include:
     - Chunk size (characters or tokens) and why that size fits your documents
     - Overlap size and why (or why not) you used overlap
     - Any preprocessing you did before chunking (e.g., stripping HTML, removing headers)
     - What your final chunk count was across all documents -->

**Chunk size:**
600 characters
**Overlap:**
100 characters
**Why these choices fit your documents:**
Most of the documents are lists with small paragraph descriptions of the specific activity or kinds of activities, so I kept the chunk size moderate, so each chunk stays focused on a single activity. I added a small overlap for some of the longer descriptions and FAQS in the blogs just in case and to follow the standard 10-20% rule for overlap. For the actual chunking strategy, I believe a recursive strategy would be best since sometimes many of the documents are broken up into sections of lists for the different activities with their descriptions inside these sections. It would follow the natural structure of the document for the majority of my sources.

For most of the sources, I needed to clean the texts to remove extra URLS, decode "&amps", and especially remove any promotional sections for blogs, such as promoting a stay at a certain hotel as that introduces bias not relevant to my domain. I also standardized the headers since I am using a recursive structure and the headers are important to the context of much of the information.

After an initial test, I decided to drop the chunk count just a little more. Most of the chunks had just a bit too much information than necessary since the descriptions under most headers across Reddit posts and blogs were a bit more brief than 700 characters. To match queries a bit more specifically, I dropped the chunk size 100 characters and the overlap by 50 to keep a 10-20% overlap of the chunk size.

The strategy will go as follows: Paragraph breaks (\n\n) -> Line breaks (\n) -> Sentences -> Characters.
**Final chunk count:**
175 Chunks

## Embedding Model

<!-- Name the embedding model you used and explain your choice.
     Then answer: if you were deploying this system for real users and cost wasn't a constraint,
     what tradeoffs would you weigh in choosing a different model?
     Consider: context length limits, multilingual support, accuracy on domain-specific text,
     latency, and local vs. API-hosted. -->

**Model used:**

**Production tradeoff reflection:**

---

## Grounded Generation

<!-- Explain how your system enforces grounding — how does it prevent the LLM from answering
     beyond the retrieved documents?
     Describe both your system prompt (what instruction you gave the model) and any structural
     choices (e.g., how you formatted the context, whether you filtered low-relevance chunks).
     Do not just say "I told it to use the documents" — show the actual instruction or explain
     the mechanism. -->

**System prompt grounding instruction:**

**How source attribution is surfaced in the response:**

## Evaluation Report

<!-- Run your 5 test questions from planning.md through your system and record the results.
     Be honest — a partially accurate or inaccurate result that you explain well is more
     valuable than a suspiciously perfect result. -->

| #   | Question | Expected answer | System response (summarized) | Retrieval quality | Response accuracy |
| --- | -------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |

## Failure Case Analysis

<!-- Identify at least one question where retrieval or generation did not work as expected.
     Write a specific explanation of *why* it failed, tied to a part of the pipeline.

     "The answer was wrong" is not an explanation.

     "The relevant information was split across a chunk boundary, so retrieval returned
     only half the context — the model didn't have enough to answer correctly" is an explanation.

     "The embedding model treated the professor's nickname as out-of-vocabulary and returned
     results from an unrelated review" is an explanation. -->

**Question that failed:**

**What the system returned:**

**Root cause (tied to a specific pipeline stage):**

**What you would change to fix it:**

---

## Spec Reflection

<!-- Reflect on how planning.md shaped your implementation.
     Answer both questions with at least 2–3 sentences each. -->

**One way the spec helped you during implementation:**

**One way your implementation diverged from the spec, and why:**

---

## AI Usage

<!-- Describe at least 2 specific instances where you used an AI tool during this project.
     For each: what did you give the AI as input, what did it produce, and what did you
     change, override, or direct differently?

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not sufficient.
     "I gave Claude my Chunking Strategy section from planning.md and asked it to implement
     chunk_text(). It returned a function using a fixed character split. I overrode the
     chunk size from 500 to 200 because my documents are short reviews, not long guides." -->

- _What I gave the AI:_
- _What it produced:_
- _What I changed or overrode:_

**Instance 2**
